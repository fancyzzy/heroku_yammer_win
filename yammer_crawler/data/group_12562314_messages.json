First I was Test & Validation Engineer for EAUS (Extended Assistant User Profile) Project, then I've been working as Support & Maintenance Engineer for the 1430 uHSS (unified Home Subscriber Server). I had to assume several roles : support and maintenance, provide 24/7 'on-call' support for after-hours calls, install and deploy our product at T- Mobile on different U.S. sites. When our product became more mature I've trained installation and level 2 support teams.\n\nIt last for almost 2 years then I became Software Design & Development Engineer for DDM (Distributed Database Management), a framework to access distributed databases for the SDM. It was my will to be more in what I considered the heart of the product. I became a technical expert, working closely with both test and support teams. I also had to train and support of \"on call\" staff. My previous experiences helped me by giving me a better understanding of their expectations. It was a big project with licenses sold for hundreds of millions of subscribers around the world, the kind of project that makes you feel that quality really matters.\n\nAnd in 2016 I needed new challenges I wanted to change to get out of my comfort zone so I've joined the SDL Project and more specifically the Service Discovery.

There is no MN score available, but since MN accounts for most of the Nokia business, the Nokia score is highly aligned to the MN performance. Since high CPV scores are correlated with higher revenues and market share - it is in the best interests of each one of us to take action to improve the Nokia CPV score.\n\nLooking to the customer feedback specific to MN, the attribute with the largest number of comments is Design Quality at 1310 comments in the last 12 months, of which 60.6% are positive. We should be quite proud of this feedback. We must also recognize this performance is not good enough because we receive strong feedback from our leading customers that our current quality performance is insufficient. So let's celebrate the high positivity status and use this as motivation to build even higher quality hardware, software, documentation and solutions.\n\nThe second and third most commented attributes are Roadmap Execution (25.6% positive) and Feature Content (46.3% positive). You read that right - both attributes are well below 50% positivity. This feedback also appears as competitive pressures when our leaders talk with customers F2F. Internally, we see the result of these poor scores - manifested as pressure to inject additional features into programs after P2 and I6.\n\nHow can we improve our performance in these two attributes, and reduce the late injection of features into programs? Throughout MN, we each play a role in improving our performance. Improvement opportunities exists in feature candidate injection into the feature screening process, reduced prioritization of features never activated, faster and higher quality R&D and Test performance, as well as improved installability. Everyone can take a role in improving our performance.\n\nIn MN, we have a CPV champions network - colleagues representing each part of MN, who are leading the analysis and actioning of our current CPV gaps.

"announcement", "system_message": false, "content_excerpt": "Dear Colleagues,\n\nYou will have seen from Rajeev\u2019s update that 5G is coming, and that it is up to all of us to deliver on the promise that 5G brings for our customers, and our company. As I have said previously, my three key priorities for this year continue to be Quality, Competitiveness, and Speed. Each element is critical to our reaching our potential so I will outline further thoughts on all three. First let me share with you the financial results for this Quarter.\n\nFinancials\nThis Quarter MN posted net sales of EUR 1565 million. Revenue came in well above Annual Plan and also higher on a Quarter-on-Quarter (Q-o-Q) basis, and slightly higher on a Year-on-Year (Y-o-Y) basis in constant currency. Operating Profit ended at a slight loss for the Quarter but favorable versus Plan with higher Net Sales offset by lower margins and higher R&D spending. NAM and India Y-o-Y revenue outperformance was offset by Europe, APJ and China, and with small cells, core, and microwave Development Units (DU\u2019s) all higher on a Q-o-Q and Y-o-Y basis. Order Intake and a good book-to-bill ratio were both positive in the Quarter. As we continue to invest in R&D to meet 5G commitments this is good news, yet we have to continue to maintain discipline as Q2 also bought declines on a Y-o-Y basis for gross margin, and sales margin.\n\nQuality\nLast week the MN Leadership Team spent time discussing several code reds that have materialized. One of the sources of these challenges is E2E collaboration which has to become faster through better collaboration between teams. With better visibility and tooling like SAFe JIRA-backlog and central Continuous Integration (CI)-tracking, people can understand what is blocking progress when, and how this can affect the big picture. Using tools like O365, including MS Teams, creates better levels of intensity with faster collaboration instead of unnecessary emails, meetings and lengthy planning. Delays can\u2019t come as a surprise. We should be able to predict and fix before the delay materializes. This requires an \u2018E2E left-shift\u2019 mindset within MN (analyzing \u2013 and fixing - what is causing the fire and not just the fire itself).\n\nOur performance during the first 6 months shows us that we are not yet on the right trajectory to meet \u2013 and beat \u2013 our MN Quality scorecard targets. Reference Architecture Compliance levels at P2 and P8 are above target and Critical Customer Issues Solution Timeliness is improving, yet currently missing its target. Confirmed outages, whilst improving slightly, are also still not meeting target levels. We are committed to results and transparency in MN and we are focused on those DU\u2019s that are underperforming. This means deep dives for each DU focusing on Product, Release and Customer cause profiles, and recovery action plans developed at Unit Dedicated Quality Review and reviewed at Unit Ops Review-level.\n\nWith the left-shift initiative score now in place, we have an assessment of the health of our Development Units left-shift programs and, more importantly, are identifying where greater focus is needed. Several DU\u2019s have shown good results including HetRAN, who achieved a ~60% reduction of customer fault arrival compared to 1H2017 results. In other DU\u2019s, the left shift programs are maturing. For those DU\u2019s who are not meeting their targets this is an issue of ownership - additional actions and resources from DU\u2019s are required to improve the health of the left shift program. Certain lagging indicators like New Customer Defect Reports show that our customers are not yet seeing the positive results from our left shift actions\n\nCompetitiveness\nYou are our competitive advantage and we don't do a good job of recognizing those of you that quietly succeed. A good attitude and good results are gender neutral, and although the proportion of women in N-3 leadership roles is now at 16.5% (vs. 13.5% at the beginning of last year) there are not enough female leaders in MN. It is our ambition to fix this. The intent is 20% of MN leaders by 2020 to be female and we will be monitoring this closely. More information on #20/2020 will be announced this Quarter.\n\nIn terms of customer wins, Tommi Uitto has outlined (https://www.yammer.com/nokia.com/#/Threads/show?threadId=1112559786) the fairly strong deal momentum that has been achieved so far this year. We have approximately the same pace in deal momentum in \u201cmarket share defining moments\u201d as at this point in 2016 and 2017. Separately we have also seen very successful 5G demos at Verizon\u2019s headquarters, and at the T-Mobile lab in the US. Our SRAN roll-out momentum continues with 201k BTS deployed (including over 11k AirScale System Modules). In LTE, a benchmarking exercise (https://www.yammer.com/nokia.com/#/Threads/show?threadId=1095453863) based on public data from 21 countries and nearly 100 cities shows that we are number 1 in the US market with 40 cities, and number 3 in the Rest of the World with 60 cities. The KPI\u2019s used were LTE Down Link and Up Link throughput, latency and availability. We are taking key actions to enhance our competitiveness with a roadmap acceleration program focusing on 5G, LTE and SRAN with all key features being measured against the best of the competition; a TCO war room for all configurations including massive MIMO cost competitiveness improvements; a Serviceability acceleration across the radio and core portfolio jointly with Global Services; and Product Security enhancements.\n\nMeanwhile, in China, a crucial market for us, we can see great teamwork, and a great outcome. Last month\u2019s 5G trial Phase III result (https://www.yammer.com/nokia.com/#/Threads/show?threadId=1110483564) announced by MIIT at the IMT-2020 5G Summit in Shenzhen, showed solid progress, and a number of achievements, including Nokia being the only vendor to complete a 4.9G RRU test, and we were the first vendor to complete a 5G NR call through a third party terminal based on a real core network on NSA infrastructure. More recently, we have the good news of the China Mobile frame agreement (https://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/2018/07/10/nokia-and-china-mobile-sign-eur-1-billion-frame-agreement) to celebrate.\n\nSpeed\nWorking closer with customers can improve time to market with a direct effect on customer outcomes, giving us more opportunities to celebrate. We therefore want all tribe leaders to have direct customer interactions - this includes preparing for, attending and following up from customer meetings. We are therefore organizing training on how to work with customers for DU\u2019s and ATF, and O365 training to make it easier for us work efficiently and collaborate better. I am also happy to see the progress being made with Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) (https://www.yammer.com/nokia.com/#/Threads/show?threadId=1093521199) in MN. We chose SAFe to increase our collaboration and clockspeed \u2013 critical elements of our move to a faster, agile and DevOps mode of operation. It is up to all of us to take the time to understand what SAFe means for MN, and to take the necessary training where required (https://www.yammer.com/nokia.com/#/Threads/show?threadId=1108167395).\n\nThis brings me to the launch of our new NAM Unit, which is moving fast. As I said at the launch, our goal is an agile, responsive Mobile Networks Business Group that quickly adjusts to customer and market requirements. This is achieved through direct collaboration between customers and respective MN DU\u2019s leading to a faster time to market for innovative solutions. North America (NAM) is the testbed for this goal and I am excited to see their progress so far.\n\nFinally, I want to thank all of you who are quietly succeeding and delivering on our ambitions and reaching our targets. We can take inspiration from your execution mindsets \u2013 it is crucial that all tribe leads working with customers are empowered to make fast decisions and collaborate using new tools. When we execute well we can build on some of the many firsts achieved over the past Quarter: First Over the Air (OTA) NSA video streaming call with the Airphone at the end of April, first full L1 release for ABIL (based on 3GPP shadow specification V4) created in early May, live 5G installations in Oulu for 3.5 GHz and 28 GHz, and industry firsts, like the Edge Cloud data center solution for the 5G era. After the hard work of H1, we are now in the summer period which means many colleagues will be taking vacations during this time. I hope that everyone is able to enjoy themselves, to take some time to catch up with family and friends, and reflect on the achievements won so far, and the opportunity that lies ahead \u2013 what an exciting time to be working in MN!\n\nWith my thanks and best wishes,\nMarc\n\ncc: Rouanne, Marc (Nokia - FR/Paris-Saclay)", "language": "en", "privacy": "public", "direct_message": false, "body": {"plain": "Dear Colleagues,\n\nYou will have seen from Rajeev\u2019s update that 5G is coming, and that it is up to all of us to deliver on the promise that 5G brings for our customers, and our company.

This is a major milestone for all of us at Nokia, a deal we have been working on for the last 12 months. The scope is massive for Nokia MN CC. At the center of the deal is the T-Mobile US Universal Subscriber Database (USD) system, it compromises of One-NDS, HLR, HSS, EIR and some 20+ custom applications from GS SI all deployed on bare metal HP hardware. We will modernize USD, evolve it to Cloud and support 5G NSA and SA architectures.\n\nWe will start with HSS 18.5 upgrades to support 5G NSA with Option 3X. Next, we will modernize the solution to a Cloud based eco-system with Airframe OR 18, NADCM, Cloudband portfolio (CBIS, CBAM and CBND). All applications will migrate to Cloud based VNF's and includes our entire MN CC SDM portfolio. It will be anchored on One-NDS and later evolve to SDL. SDL 19 will initially be used for LIVE friendly user trials and evolve to SDL 19 SP1 for replacing the current One-NDS over time.\n\nWe will also deploy our 5GC portfolio on the new USD Cloud infrastructure. 5GC SA (Option 2) lab trials will begin in Jan 2019 with UDR, UDM, and AUSF and SMSF. Other 5G core solutions included in the deal are AMF, NSSF and NRF and PCF from our ION & NSW portfolio. In 2H19, we will start commercial field trials with Release 19.5 portfolio for standalone 5G system, and start migrating subscribers from One-NDS to SDL 19 SP1 baseline.\n\nWe must urgently deliver the 29 racks of Airframe OR 18 HW in the next 6-8 weeks. 4 nodes go into the new T-Mobile labs so we can certify our Cloud Infrastructure with CBIS 18. Cloud HSS 18.5 goes next, followed by other applications. While the lab verification is taking place, we need install the OR 18 HW in legacy MSO's where space, power and cooling remain key challenges for our customer. Each MSO has 8 racks with 4 racks per PoD (each POD is managed by a single CBIS instance). We need to get the NADCM and NetAct integration complete for our hardware management solution by mid-August.\n\nWe need to in parallel verify internally in the BL our E2E Cloud solutions with OR18, CBIS 18 and applications like cHSS 18.5 to start with. We will start directing traffic to the Cloud FE's and prove solution stability and scale and switch off the bare metal front ends gradually as customer gets confidence in our Cloud eco-system.\n\nSDL 19 validation in 4Q18 is vital for us to implement a limited commercial trial in 1Q19 while we get more functionality for replacing One-NDS eco-system with SDL 19.1 in mid-2019. In parallel we will have 5GC lab trials starting in Jan 2019 and moving to commercial LIVE trials in 2H19. We will also have the T-Mobile - Sprint NewCo initiatives, and migrate subs from One-NDS to Cloud.\n\nThis is our opportunity to lead the way for Nokia to be successful with 5G. As T-Mobile leads the industry in a nationwide 5G network deployment it will help shape our products and solutions and give us the competitive edge over others in this industry.\n\nThank you all for your continued support.", "language": "en", "privacy": "public", "direct_message": false, "body": {"plain": "Leading the way with T-Mobile 5GC\n---\nIt has been an exciting week, we have now signed our 5G commercial contract with T-Mobile USA!

Thanks for all the participants: Li Lerro, Shi Erin, Sun Sarah, Zhang Sally, Gao Kerry, Gao Candy, Yang Edward.\nLet us move to the second official practice. The game does not require any knowledge of DevOps nor is any specific role demanded. Also, the players do not need to be from the same team.

DevOps and Agile testing)\n- Techniques (from fundamentals up to Quality control)\n- Usage of different tools\n\nCurriculum on SW test automation:\n- Basic understanding about the Test Automation (TA) environment, tools and techniques\n- Workshops about using and improving TA\n- Become Linux expert and train others on TA\n\nOur future training programs will include dedicated paths for each functional role introduced in the basic level curriculum. The content of these programs will be created by the subject matter experts working in these roles already today. More details on this will be shared in the coming months.\n\nThe basic level is available now, other levels will be published soon:\n- Testing Skillset \u2013 Basic level for developer | MN00831-K-1803 (https://nokialearn.csod.com/DeepLink/ProcessRedirect.aspx?module=lodetails&lo=7030b4aa-132d-4f77-880d-d6f6ab5c016e)\n- Testing Skillset \u2013 Basic level for SW test automation | MN00832-K-1803 (https://nokialearn.csod.com/LMS/LoDetails/DetailsLo.aspx?loid=2b6003b6-5c2f-4215-8f53-3ed7ee38bdc3)\n- Testing Skillset \u2013 Basic level for HW test automation (under creation)\n\nThorsten Henke (https://eur.delve.office.com/?u=d6cf4e58-3212-4df5-be24-dee4c8e63770&v=work), MN 4G RAN Productization Ulm, is leading the testing skillset activities in Mobile Networks.

In order to innovate and create, our brains ask for stimulation that learning can provide. To help us keep learning at the top of our priority list and part of our daily routines, NokiaEDU is introducing a Learning Index: an easy way to find the most relevant learning for you and track your professional development throughout the year.\n\nHere\u2019s how your Personal Learning Index works: each time you complete a defined, recommended or freestyle learning, you earn points. Bonus points are granted for learning aligned with MN priorities. Social learning is also captured by the Index by awarding points for relevant Yammer posts. Other ways to earn learning and sharing points will be added throughout 2018. The goal is for your Squad Group to reach 100% of its recommended learning target (92 points) before year-end. Will your group be the first one to reach that target? If you want to get involved in setting your Squad, Tribe or Unit priorities, reach out to your squad/tribe lead who can work with our Competence Development (CoDe) & EDU team to adjust accordingly.\n\nBy utilizing the Index as a guide for your learning investment, you are contributing to a learning culture in MN and Nokia that ultimately supports our business and your professional success. The more you learn and share, the more points you gain. Best of all, it\u2019s easy to use: all learning in Nokia\u2019s Learning and Development Hub and sharing via Yammer are automatically linked to the Index and calculated for you.\n\nYour personal Learning Index is already set up and waiting for you \u2013 access it here at the Achievement Center (https://nokia.sharepoint.com/sites/learn/achiev/SitePages/index.aspx#home), along with videos, FAQs and other helpful information.

Now some might say that Miami is not a bad place to get stuck in but the old adage comes to mind that there truly is \u201cNo place like home.\u201d Hopefully, deciding to keep my Thursday flight and gamble on the air traffic control system instead of trying to leave earlier today is the last bad decision I make in 2018! Speaking of 2018, first, I\u2019d like to wish all of you a very healthy, happy and prosperous New Year. As we all know, 2017 was a year full of challenges and many will continue on into 2018 but the light at the end of tunnel is starting to glimmer just a bit as the momentum is beginning to build on our new MoO in Mobile Networks.\n2017 was a year of massive change especially in MN with more change in the last 3 months than I have sometimes seen in years over my career! At times it seemed like we were on a treadmill, increasing speed to the point of exhaustion with no time to relax. At other times it seemed like the continuous flow of requests for additional information with tight due dates was overwhelming. Add to this the continuous messaging from our customers that they were not yet seeing the power of the new Nokia resulting in their questioning our ability to compete effectively. It is in times like these that you can either go into zero productivity oscillation or take a deep breath, step back, look at the priorities and make sure through it all that you never lose focus on the most important aspect of our business \u2013 serving our customers \u2013 while the other needs are serviced adequately to keep the train running on the rails.\nI am very fortunate to have a leadership team that supports me and each other quite well allowing for us to share the burden and to lift each other up if when the needs exceed one\u2019s peak capacity to address. They lift me up when I am down and my New Year\u2019s wish for all of you is that you have and remember the people that have \u201cPacked your parachutes\u201d over your careers. The \"Packing your parachutes\" story references an aviator, Charles Plumb, who was shot down in a war and one day several years later came to meet the person who packed his parachute that day he bailed out of his airplane. In part due to that chance meeting Plumb became a motivational speaker asking everyone to think about the people who may have helped each person's career by using the metaphor of \"Packing your parachutes\" and to pay that favor going forward for others.\nWhen I look back at 2017, I see many things that I am proud of having been a part of like turning around the customer perception of Nokia at AT&T, to positioning ourselves to get the migrations going for our key customers to working with my team and my colleagues to enable this massive change within MN. One of the old adages that I am sure you have heard in the past is \u201cThe first part of tackling a problem is admitting that you have one.\u201d Well, it is clear that we embraced the fact that future success can not be guaranteed by doing our MN business the same way we have done in the past. We have chosen a new direction with a foundation of Cloudified services based on 5G in preparation for one of the largest network infrastructure transformations in Wireless since the advent of digital cellular. Will this guarantee success? Not by itself, but it has the potential to be game changing as long as \u2026.. we deliver to our customers with quality!\nThe lack of quality is the second problem that we admitted we were suffering from in MN. The tendency to cut corners increases when deliveries are late and the competitive pressures for time to market are rapidly increasing. Of course, deciding to deliver or not is all about measuring business risk however one truth repeats over and over again \u2013 failure to deliver quality HW and SW causes a loss of market share.\nWhat would I have done differently in 2017? Well, since we were making progress on quality in Baseband I was a bit cautious of moving to the target model for MN very rapidly as opposed to progressing over a measured period of time. In retrospect, moving faster would have been better and this will be a major focus of our first leadership team meeting in 2018. Also, I could have been a better advocate for advancing quality initiatives more rapidly inside our business and driving more competitive benchmarking vs incremental improvement. Lessons learned.\nSo, enough about my perspectives on 2017. As is my custom, I\u2019d like to share with you a few reflections from my library. And, for those of you who told me last year that you \u201cSaw this one before\u201d to which I responded that many Nokians were seeing them for the first time, I have decided to include both some new items as well as a few \u201cclassics.\"\n\nFirst, from the \u201cclassic\u201d repertoire, a short reflection on the changing dynamics of time in our lives which I try to remember every day but honestly find a hard time achieving the target balance intended.

His name is Michael Reuter and I have saved some of his best snippets from all of his messages. Today, I\u2019d like to share a few of them with you.\n\nFrom 3 Minute Leadership Messages by Michael Reuter:\nIn his book, The Energy Bus, Jon Gordon shares his thoughts on ten rules he suggests that great leaders should follow to bring energy to their life, work and those whom they serve. In these rules, we find the call for personal ownership, vision, passion, enthusiasm, purpose and caring, a life in which every moment is filled with radiant positive energy - the source of energy, initiative and happiness.\n\n10 RULES FOR THE RIDE OF YOUR LIFE\n1. You\u2019re the driver of your bus.\n2. Desire, vision, and focus move your bus in the right direction.\n3. Fuel your ride with positive energy.\n4. Invite people on your bus and share your vision for the road ahead.\n5. Don\u2019t waste your energy on those who don\u2019t get on your bus.\n6. Post a sign that says \u201cNo Energy Vampires Allowed\u201d on your bus.\n7. Enthusiasm attracts more passengers and energizes them during the ride.\n8. Love your passengers.\n9. Drive with purpose.\n10. Have fun and enjoy the ride.\n\nFrom Zig Ziglar\u2019s life and teachings \u2013 the following is beautifully captured in his words:\n\u201cDesire is what takes the hot water of mediocrity and turns it into the steam of outstanding success.\u201d\n\"You cannot climb the ladder of success dressed in the costume of failure.\"\n\u201cWe cannot start over, but we can begin now and make a new ending.\u201d\n\u201cYour attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude.\u201d\n\"If you want to reach a goal, you must 'see the reaching' in your own mind before you actually arrive at your goal.\"\n\u201cThere are no traffic jams on the extra mile.\u201d\n\u201cConfidence is going after Moby Dick in a rowboat and taking tartar sauce with you.\u201d\n\nIn his book, How Successful People Think, John Maxwell writes: \u201cI\u2019ve studied successful people for forty years and, though the diversity you find among them is astounding, I\u2019ve found that they are all alike in one way: how they think. That is the one thing that separates successful people from unsuccessful ones.\u201d\n\nMaxwell shares his thoughts on the eleven skills, the key thinking \u2018pieces\u2019, that great leaders need if they are to achieve great things. His teaching focuses not on the \u2018what\u2019 to think, but on the \u2018how\u2019 to think with strong emphasis placed on all the pieces working together to make a magnificent symphony.\n\nSeeing the wisdom of big-picture thinking\nUnleashing the potential of focused thinking\nDiscovering the joy of creative thinking\nRecognizing the importance of realistic thinking\nReleasing the power of strategic thinking\nFeeling the energy of possibility thinking\nEmbracing the lessons of reflective thinking\nQuestioning the acceptance of popular thinking\nEncouraging the participation of shared thinking\nExperiencing the satisfaction of unselfish thinking\nEnjoying the return of bottom-line thinking\n\nHere\u2019s wishing all of you a THOUGHTFUL and ENJOYABLE 2018!

Scaled Agile Training and Good Practices Sharing\n\nAround 32 members from MN Cloud Core and HetRAN-G joined Qingdao MN scaled agile training and good practices sharing on 28th and 29th of Dec 2017. The training includes two sessions, Spotify scaling agile practice and SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework).\n\nIn the first day of the training, the external famous agile coach Zhou Jingen introduced the practice of Spotify. By the direction of his gamification teaching methods, all the participants got and understood the spirit of the scaling agile of Spotify. That is \u201cautonomy\u201d and \u201calignment\u201d. The team members are provided autonomy in terms of decision making based on the same objective and value stream. This kind of concept is highly consistent with our MN transformation idea. Everyone benefited a lot from the training of Spotify practice.\n\nSAFe was derived from the former NOKIA and this is why it is very suitable for the huge telecommunication company. In the second day of the training, Li Jianhao, an expert of enterprise agility transformation, showed the basic knowledge of SAFe. It covered the four levels of SAFe (Team, Program, Solution and Portfolio), as well as some good practice cases from other companies. All we know that SAFe and the GIT tool technology have been chosen to support DevOps and Agile development in Mobile Networks. By the learning and sharing, it is believed that the participants can provide more productivity in the way of pushing SAFe and DevOps.\n\nThe Q&A sessions were interleaved in the whole 2 days\u2019 training. A lot of questions from the participants were raised and discussed. Although not all the questions were clarified, comprehensive agile information were delivered under the heated discussion and everyone could get more close to the best practice which is fit for our corporation.\n\nThis is really an unforgettable and impressive training. We believe the participants can support their team members entering into a more agile organization in the near future.\n\ncc: Chen, Ming Seaman.

The following rules are to be applied to all programs effective immediately.\n\nFault Not Reproducible (FNR)\n\nFault Not Reproducible (FNR) / One time occurrence fault is any SW/HW fault which is not reproducible in the labs. In this case additional analysis of available logs does not enable root cause identification or lead to fault correction.\n\nFNR/One time occurrence faults can be excluded from the release Virtual Zero count.\n\nIf the fault re-occurs a second time, it cannot be treated as FNR anymore and must be included in the VZ count.\n\nConditions\n\n1. FNR is applicable only for B and C class faults found in R&D, CST, or Customer Environment.\n2. FNR/One time occurrence of the fault must be confirmed with the tester who originally reported the fault.\n3. Minimum monitoring period before fault can be categorized as FNR is 14 days from the first report date.\n4. An aggressive attempt to reproduce and find root cause must be completed (Number of attempts, number of configurations checked, varied traffic loads, etc. )\n5. FNR backlog must be managed at < 5 to guard against an unstable release and technical debt. Periodic RCA/EDA of FNR root causes must be completed to trigger continuous improvement actions to further improve quality.\n6.

I am pleased to see what has been accomplished so far: we now have 240 tribes and approximately 3000 squads in place, which are all adapting their ways of working to our new R&D blueprint and our new operational model. We are working with greater speed, and this is down to your hard work.\n\nNow is the right time to continue our transformation by focusing on further simplification, co-location and defragmentation. The aim is to set up teams with the right people at the right place to make sure they are working on strategically important technologies in high-priority areas. This will mean that squad and tribe members can work in the most efficient, agile and rapid manner. To accomplish this, a number of individual employees or even entire squads are planned to be transferred to other squad groups, tribes, Development Units or Functions. Approximately 2000 employees are in the scope of the planned changes. In majority of the reassignment cases the receiving organization is either 5G RAN, ATF or Cloud Solutions. We will see, among others, Commercial Management and Business Digitalization and ATF re-organizing their set-ups for further simplification and streamlining. The related changes are expected to become effective as of December 11, subject to engagement of employee representatives in line with local legal processes and practices, where needed. Your line manager will share the details with you if you are impacted by these reassignment or re-organization efforts.\n\nWhy do we do these reassignments and re-organizations? MN continues to invest in 5G and Cloud and is broadening its focus into multiple areas of early 5G mobility use cases. This focus may require a shift of resources to strengthen the related development teams. We are constantly assessing where to invest as we need to be able to quickly react to changing customer needs and market conditions. These planned reassignments and re-organizations are the result of our quarterly investment reviews. They will give us the opportunity to learn new things and to broaden our experience and capabilities by working in important areas of the business. We plan to continue our transformation in quarterly waves, both to address organizational enhancements as well as to rotate people to work where it matters the most.\n\nI am convinced that these initiatives will help us to improve efficiency and strengthen our bottom line to create the right internal environment for long-term sustainable growth.\n\nOur aim is to create a modern, and motivational experience for our R&D engineers to innovate efficiently in the areas outlined by our strategy,\u00a0and to do so with a quality-first mindset. A common toolset is key in this context. We recently announced (https://www.yammer.com/nokia.com/#/Threads/show?threadId=982406938) that we have chosen Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) and the GIT tool technology to support DevOps and Agile development in Mobile Networks. SAFe is an overall agile development framework that will help to bridge our processes from business management and development to agile continuous delivery. It\u2019s a great way to scale large projects in large organizations. The GIT framework will be an integral part of our common toolset for software configuration management with the decision to go towards GERRIT for radio and GITLAB for other parts.\n\nGoing forward let me ask you to do four things to support these efforts:\nFirst, keep your Delve profile up to date to help others to find you: Delve should be the first location you use to find a colleague. Delve will be our main people resource, and to make the most of it, I strongly encourage you to upload your skills and the projects that you have worked on onto Delve. Transparency will help us share knowledge and make decisions faster. If people can see what you know, and what you have worked on, not only will it save time hunting for the right colleague to speak with, it will also make it easier for you to work on interesting new projects in the future.\n\nSecond, take the next 1 in 90 conversation with your line manager as an opportunity to discuss your personal career aspirations. These reassignments offer great opportunities for personal development and you can proactively discuss a potential reassignment with your line manager if you wish to broaden your expertise.\n\nThird, check out and bookmark the MN Intranet site (https://nokia.sharepoint.com/MN/) and MN Transformation site (https://nokia.sharepoint.com/sites/MN_Transformation/SitePages/Home.aspx) where you can find a one stop shop for MN, and MN transformation-related information, and get engaged in the discussions on the MN all Yammer forum (https://www.yammer.com/nokia.com/#/threads/inGroup?type=in_group&feedId=7138094&view=all).\n\nFinally, if you have not yet participated in the second round of the Change Map survey (https://survey.changetracking.com/survey/nokia/mn-all/dec-2017)\u00a0do take the time to fill-out the questionnaire. Your opinion matters, and I am eager to get feedback from MN squads and tribes what they think on our transformation. The survey results will be shared MN-wide in January, and they will be our compass - helping us to decide what to focus on next in our transformation journey.\n\nMarc\n\nFor further material: MN Transformation team site\u00a0(http://nok.it/IfsjqY)", "language": "en", "privacy": "public", "direct_message": false, "body": {"plain": "Dear colleagues,\n\nWe are in the midst of a continuous transformation, which we kicked off in May.

I am very grateful to all the colleagues in the TCs who enabled this for me, and you could see some impressions posted previously by the TC colleagues on Yammer that I will not repeat. It was important for me and DIA program to be there due to importance of China market itself, but also due to innovation and business opportunities it brings. With the current pace of development, it is not wrong to say that China might become a new Silicon Valley, as some of the leading VCs are already predicting. Imagine the number of high quality engineers only in Nokia, but also in general in China and the market opportunity to scale all great new products first on domestic China market and then to scale it globally. Actually, the most successful, so called digital giants from China (Tencent, Baidu and Alibaba) are also doing the same. On top of this, on the recent top 10 most valued startups list from Wall Street Journal, there are four coming from China. The first place is still reserved for Uber valued >60BUSD, but the second position is reserved for Didi Chuxing valued already at 50BUSD. You can see the up-to-dated list here: http://graphics.wsj.com/billion-dollar-club/ . I am quite sure that next year there will be even more. One very important topic for DIA is artificial intelligence and machine and deep learning. We already fund some projects related to this. This is also where the importance of China is growing. Its government is planning to invest hundreds of billions of yuan (tens of billions of euros) into technology in coming years and companies are investing heavily in nurturing and developing related talents. Even one of MIT magazines wrote about this recently. History teaches us that usually this kind of China wide efforts usually succeed (remember high speed trains or telecommunications from the past, just to name a few) and this could make very soon China a leading force in AI. This plan wants homegrown AI to match that of in the US within three years, then China to make \u201cmajor breakthroughs\u201d by 2025 and China to be the AI leader in the world by 2030. Even now, China has some big advantages in AI \u2013 great base of talented engineers, but also data richness necessary to train AI systems and algorithms. Large amount of data makes a large amount of difference. I can only hope that Nokia will take also the advantage of these trends (respecting always Nokia ethical and data privacy standards, of course). As one of the great names in AI Andrew Ng said, \u201cwhen you see technology trends shift, you had better move quickly, or someone else will beat you\u201d. This is the btw the key for DIA \u2013 move quickly and test as many as new ideas as possible and either fail fast or be successful fast (in AI or in any other business area).\nBesides having open discussion in town hall with many colleagues and many questions on DIA, I was also very excited to see that DIA video is running on internal displays and that DIA posters are all over the buildings in the TCs :-). I was impressed with the quality and maturity of business proposals and competencies of our colleagues in China. I already mentioned AI as an important topic, but my mind was \u201cblown away\u201d when I saw what a great AI/ML competence we have with some of the colleagues, I met during these days. We also reviewed with TC leadership teams and innoboards / garages some very exciting business ideas proposals that will soon enter the DIA funnel. As China is such a big market, if we would be able to make new business based on these ideas, the impact could be huge. We also discussed with TC leadership teams, innoboards / garages that they can support DIA in China as a local mentor or \u201csparring partner\u201d for potential DIA intrapreneurs. I was also stressing the new role of ATF organization (where DIA program belongs) as the key owner of architecture and technology creation for MN. We also agreed that we will jointly organize hackathons or brainathons in the near future on the business challenges we will together agree. Furthermore, in Beijing I also had a good meeting with the colleagues organizing IQ quality workshops that I mentioned in one of my previous posts, and we agreed that innovations resulting from these workshops will be applied to DIA program. This way we will make sure that all great possible business ideas or innovation will have the chance to be implemented by the idea owners, if they wish to do so. Last, but not least we had our DIA presentation on Hangzhou innovation day.\nI also have to say that I am great admirer of China\u2018s culture and heritage. Due to that fact, but not only because of that, I wanted to explain the DIA story using Chinese proverbs as much as possible. I would like to share this also with you all in this Yammer post. So, let\u2019s start the DIA journey with the help of Chinese proverbs.\n1. \u201cNot having heard something is not as good as having heard it; having heard it is not as good as having seen it; having seen it is not as good as knowing it; knowing it is not as good as putting it into practice.\u201d This is what we want to do in DIA, we want to put all the great knowledge that we have in our company and great ideas into practice, we do not want to keep the great innovations or ideas not implemented due to whatever challenges we might have in the company. Only when we start to implement something, we will face all the challenges and test whether the business idea will work or not. And we want to be fast in this i.e. test and then either fail fast or succeed and move fast and gain the market, as I already said above.\n2. \u201cReading ten thousand books is not as useful as travelling ten thousand miles\u201d. We want that our employees participating in DIA program develop themselves, develop business and entrepreneurial skills and have business ownership. They can do this the best, if they are challenged with all the problems they will encounter in running and growing their internal startups. This might be like a full MBA type of experience with the key difference that all the skills and knowledge are tested and applied immediately in practice. This is one of the key reasons why we have DIA program from our employees benefit point of view.\n3. \"If you want one year of prosperity, grow grain. If you want 10 years of prosperity, grow trees. If you want 100 years of prosperity, grow people\u201d. We hope that the great benefit for Nokia from DIA is that we will generate new and growing businesses for Nokia. Therefore, we want to give the chance to our people to do this and through their own personal development, enable the growth of Nokia. This could be one contribution to help us make Nokia the best workplace in the world and the best employer of choice, especially for fresh university graduates.\n4. \"The emperor is rich, but he cannot buy one extra year\u201c. If somebody had a great business idea, perhaps one of the reasons in the past why this was not implemented was that he did not have money or resources to do so. This is not anymore, an \u201cexcuse\u201d, as if one wants to implement own business idea, now there is a chance with internal MN Venture Capital \u2013 DIA program.\n5. \u201cTeachers open the door. You enter by yourself\u201d. When developing and executing the internal startup business, the employee (intrapreneur) is not left alone to execute. From his application to the program to the end of the startup and potential successful transfer to normal business, the intrapreneur is coached by the DIA coach and DIA concierge team who helps him/her with all possible issues e.g. preparing the funding pitch, ordering materials or developers\u2019 work, establishing contact with sales teams, legal, HR, F&C etc.. Our intention is to make our intrapreneur successful by providing all this help. And this is not normally available in the external startup world.\n6. \u201cWhen there is a will, there is a way\u201d. Our key requirement is that intrapreneurs think about real customer problems, real pain points for whoever might be the customer. The reason for this is that in one external startup study about why startups failed, 42% of respondents answered that the main reason was no market for their product. Therefore, we believe if we identify the right problem and huge pain point for potential customer and solve it with our solution, there is a way to execute through all possible ups and downs in a startup lifecycle. And, we want that our intrapreneurs think big when looking for the pain points and their solutions.\n7. \u201cFailure is the mother of success\u201d. We touched this point many times so far and this is kind of a mantra in S. Valley that it is not problem to fail with your startup, if you did all what it takes to try to make it successful. As T. Edison said: \u201cI haven\u2019t fail. I just found 10000 ways that won\u2019t work\u201d.\n8. \u201cTalk doesn\u2019t cook the rice\u201d. This is related to our key requirement that we are not only interested in ideas of our colleagues, but we want to have the colleagues joining DIA with the business idea, but also willingness and ability to execute this idea. This is the key for the success of this program. We believe that idea is just 1%, while persistence is 99% (although it is true that if the idea is not good enough, the rest will probably not bring much).\nAs said at the beginning, China is already now a great (external) startup location and will be even more in the coming years. We need to ensure we benefit from the great talents we have with our colleagues in China and the great opportunities coming from this great country. I am really looking to see many new internal startups from China TCs and great future businesses and success for all of us in China and globally. It is important to highlight again: \u201cWhen there is a will, there is a way\u201d.", "language": "en", "privacy": "public", "direct_message": false, "body": {"plain": "We have made a big step in the promotion of DIA to all our colleagues by visiting 5 China TCs (Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao and Hangzhou).

This plan wants homegrown AI to match that of in the US within three years, then China to make \u201cmajor breakthroughs\u201d by 2025 and China to be the AI leader in the world by 2030. Even now, China has some big advantages in AI \u2013 great base of talented engineers, but also data richness necessary to train AI systems and algorithms. Large amount of data makes a large amount of difference. I can only hope that Nokia will take also the advantage of these trends (respecting always Nokia ethical and data privacy standards, of course). As one of the great names in AI Andrew Ng said, \u201cwhen you see technology trends shift, you had better move quickly, or someone else will beat you\u201d. This is the btw the key for DIA \u2013 move quickly and test as many as new ideas as possible and either fail fast or be successful fast (in AI or in any other business area).\nBesides having open discussion in town hall with many colleagues and many questions on DIA, I was also very excited to see that DIA video is running on internal displays and that DIA posters are all over the buildings in the TCs :-). I was impressed with the quality and maturity of business proposals and competencies of our colleagues in China. I already mentioned AI as an important topic, but my mind was \u201cblown away\u201d when I saw what a great AI/ML competence we have with some of the colleagues, I met during these days. We also reviewed with TC leadership teams and innoboards / garages some very exciting business ideas proposals that will soon enter the DIA funnel. As China is such a big market, if we would be able to make new business based on these ideas, the impact could be huge. We also discussed with TC leadership teams, innoboards / garages that they can support DIA in China as a local mentor or \u201csparring partner\u201d for potential DIA intrapreneurs. I was also stressing the new role of ATF organization (where DIA program belongs) as the key owner of architecture and technology creation for MN. We also agreed that we will jointly organize hackathons or brainathons in the near future on the business challenges we will together agree. Furthermore, in Beijing I also had a good meeting with the colleagues organizing IQ quality workshops that I mentioned in one of my previous posts, and we agreed that innovations resulting from these workshops will be applied to DIA program. This way we will make sure that all great possible business ideas or innovation will have the chance to be implemented by the idea owners, if they wish to do so. Last, but not least we had our DIA presentation on Hangzhou innovation day.\nI also have to say that I am great admirer of China\u2018s culture and heritage. Due to that fact, but not only because of that, I wanted to explain the DIA story using Chinese proverbs as much as possible. I would like to share this also with you all in this Yammer post. So, let\u2019s start the DIA journey with the help of Chinese proverbs.\n1. \u201cNot having heard something is not as good as having heard it; having heard it is not as good as having seen it; having seen it is not as good as knowing it; knowing it is not as good as putting it into practice.\u201d This is what we want to do in DIA, we want to put all the great knowledge that we have in our company and great ideas into practice, we do not want to keep the great innovations or ideas not implemented due to whatever challenges we might have in the company. Only when we start to implement something, we will face all the challenges and test whether the business idea will work or not. And we want to be fast in this i.e. test and then either fail fast or succeed and move fast and gain the market, as I already said above.\n2. \u201cReading ten thousand books is not as useful as travelling ten thousand miles\u201d. We want that our employees participating in DIA program develop themselves, develop business and entrepreneurial skills and have business ownership. They can do this the best, if they are challenged with all the problems they will encounter in running and growing their internal startups. This might be like a full MBA type of experience with the key difference that all the skills and knowledge are tested and applied immediately in practice. This is one of the key reasons why we have DIA program from our employees benefit point of view.\n3. \"If you want one year of prosperity, grow grain. If you want 10 years of prosperity, grow trees. If you want 100 years of prosperity, grow people\u201d. We hope that the great benefit for Nokia from DIA is that we will generate new and growing businesses for Nokia. Therefore, we want to give the chance to our people to do this and through their own personal development, enable the growth of Nokia. This could be one contribution to help us make Nokia the best workplace in the world and the best employer of choice, especially for fresh university graduates.\n4. \"The emperor is rich, but he cannot buy one extra year\u201c. If somebody had a great business idea, perhaps one of the reasons in the past why this was not implemented was that he did not have money or resources to do so. This is not anymore, an \u201cexcuse\u201d, as if one wants to implement own business idea, now there is a chance with internal MN Venture Capital \u2013 DIA program.\n5. \u201cTeachers open the door. You enter by yourself\u201d. When developing and executing the internal startup business, the employee (intrapreneur) is not left alone to execute. From his application to the program to the end of the startup and potential successful transfer to normal business, the intrapreneur is coached by the DIA coach and DIA concierge team who helps him/her with all possible issues e.g. preparing the funding pitch, ordering materials or developers\u2019 work, establishing contact with sales teams, legal, HR, F&C etc.. Our intention is to make our intrapreneur successful by providing all this help. And this is not normally available in the external startup world.\n6. \u201cWhen there is a will, there is a way\u201d. Our key requirement is that intrapreneurs think about real customer problems, real pain points for whoever might be the customer. The reason for this is that in one external startup study about why startups failed, 42% of respondents answered that the main reason was no market for their product. Therefore, we believe if we identify the right problem and huge pain point for potential customer and solve it with our solution, there is a way to execute through all possible ups and downs in a startup lifecycle. And, we want that our intrapreneurs think big when looking for the pain points and their solutions.\n7. \u201cFailure is the mother of success\u201d. We touched this point many times so far and this is kind of a mantra in S. Valley that it is not problem to fail with your startup, if you did all what it takes to try to make it successful. As T. Edison said: \u201cI haven\u2019t fail. I just found 10000 ways that won\u2019t work\u201d.\n8. \u201cTalk doesn\u2019t cook the rice\u201d. This is related to our key requirement that we are not only interested in ideas of our colleagues, but we want to have the colleagues joining DIA with the business idea, but also willingness and ability to execute this idea. This is the key for the success of this program. We believe that idea is just 1%, while persistence is 99% (although it is true that if the idea is not good enough, the rest will probably not bring much).\nAs said at the beginning, China is already now a great (external) startup location and will be even more in the coming years. We need to ensure we benefit from the great talents we have with our colleagues in China and the great opportunities coming from this great country. I am really looking to see many new internal startups from China TCs and great future businesses and success for all of us in China and globally. It is important to highlight again: \u201cWhen there is a will, there is a way\u201d."}}], "liked_by": {"count": 1, "names": [{"full_name": "Li, Ellen J.

Our Quality Management teams establish the MN quality ambition, strategy, process and policies, including developing and governing the multi-year KPIs, essential to keeping our sights focused on current performance while proactively identifying improvement areas.

The Rapid Quality Intervention teams deliver fast turnaround assessments and analysis to launch programs that surgically address immediate customer pain-points as well as systemics that present risks within MN or across Nokia.

Innovation is sometimes considered as an important but not urgent task in engineers daily work, when people know some innovation big guy filed a patent, they feel nothing, but when he/she got to know that someone in his/her average filed a patent, this makes them know patent is not so far away from them but achievable, they will put their ideas into a submission right away.\n\nIn the latest

Sorry for this longish mail, but I need to share this.\n\nRJIO wanted to share their strategy and concerns about our responsiveness and lack of flexibility and discuss what they expect from us on their way towards the next 100 mio VoLTE subs. We are a key vendor in their network and crucial for their growth plans, so this was a very important meeting.\n\u00a0\nWe knew, that it would be a tough meeting and I joined it on short notice to show our commitment and explain our plans to address their concerns and our plans and strategy towards cloud core. I must say, this was one of the most remarkable meetings, I have had with customers in at least the last 10 years. Really something to learn from and I believe important to share with the full Cloud Core team.\nWe got some very important messages for our transformation journey that go far beyond this project that we need to focus on.\n\u00a0\nTo make it short, they have \"grilled\" me for 3 1/2 hours and it got very clear that our current way of operation does not work for customers like them. They want to move extremely fast and add another 100 mio subs with an iconic low cost, but high-end services phone. They showed it to us, it looks like a simple feature phone, but has almost everything you would expect from a high end smart phone, incl. voice control (any language!), video, full VoLTE stack, except the form factor that looks like a feature phone. It will be rolled out in volume soon and the network needs to be properly prepared for this. Really impressive.\n\u00a0\nThe approach, they are taking is very different from many other customers. They want to disrupt the market with new technologies, outpace competition with an enormous own competence to shape technology to their needs. Speed and flexibility is key for them and they do not understand, why it takes us months and years to solve specific requests.\n\nBut there is even more. I am used to get challenged on quality, roadmaps, serviceability, etc., but this time it was on a deep technical level, even down to call flows and architectural details.

We gave as answer that this has been standardized just in 3GG R14 and we therefore need some time to implement (Q1 next year). Their response to this was, it is standardized since R13 and they can even tell us exactly what to change to make it work. The person, who raised it, explained he was even part of the standardization and does not see any reason, why this cannot be done very quickly. Right or wrong, we at least haven\u2019t discussed directly with him and left the impression, we do not really understand their need and just looking for excuses to not do it.\n\nThe other one was \u201cdebug and transaction logs\u201d. This is a topic that is open since more than 1 \u00bd years and we now promised to deliver in Q1 next year. So far, we did not even specify any date. We all know, that this is a really complex topic, but they claimed, they have got this from each and every product in their network, except our IMS. They do not understand, why the RCAs takes so long and even claimed to it on their own, if we can provide them the respective traces and dumps. They asked us very directly, why we can design a product w/o such basic functionality.\n\nI mention these specific cases not to discuss, if it\u2019s right or wrong or to blame anybody. It just shows, what they really want: get in touch directly with the R&D experts, discuss and solve the issues as we go and we all benefit from the innovation and speed that such a close cooperation would bring. Sounds like truly fast and agile and Devops, right?\n\nI truly believe that these guys are really disrupting our industry. They are extremely ambitious and demanding and we need to work as close with them, as we can. There will be more and more projects and customers like this - e.g. 3UK is moving in the same direction - and the closer we can work with them, the faster we can learn and adapt and differentiate from others, who do not have the same experience.\n\nAny crisis creates also opportunities. We have learned it e.g. from the Verizon case some time ago. It is painful at the beginning, but at the end it really helps and elevates us to the next level. I believe, we should do the same here.\n\nI also believe, we can manage that. They e.g. mentioned, that the R&D support was excellent at the beginning. We have given them dedicated R&D support and attention when the network was build. Once it was up and running, we however moved out and went back to our standard way of working and we ended up in the situation we are in right now. The customer is very frustrated and questioning, if we are the right partner for them to go forward with their ambitious plans. Not good at all.\n\nMy learning out of this meeting is, that we need to get back to where we have been: get in direct touch with them, discuss, understand, move quickly and learn and adapt as we go. Reliance JIO is one, if not THE, most disruptive and innovative operator in this industry. They also have a very aggressive plan to go to the cloud. They e.g. claim to have an even bigger cloud infrastructure than ATT by now and they are the fastest growing VoLTE network anyway. Let\u2019s step up here and try a different approach. I am convinced, this way of working is the future: fast, agile, truly cloud based and all of this in a very close contact with the customer.\n\nWe simply cannot miss that chance, what do you think?\n\nCheers,\nMichael", "language": "en", "privacy": "public", "direct_message": false, "body": {"plain": "Hallo MN Cloud Core team,\n\u00a0\nI would like to share some feedback from a very interesting meeting, that Rajeev, Ashish and I had with Manoj Modi and his management team in Mumbai. Sorry for this longish mail, but I need to share this.\n\nRJIO wanted to share their strategy and concerns about our responsiveness and lack of flexibility and discuss what they expect from us on their way towards the next 100 mio VoLTE subs. We are a key vendor in their network and crucial for their growth plans, so this was a very important meeting.\n\u00a0\nWe knew, that it would be a tough meeting and I joined it on short notice to show our commitment and explain our plans to address their concerns and our plans and strategy towards cloud core. I must say, this was one of the most remarkable meetings, I have had with customers in at least the last 10 years. Really something to learn from and I believe important to share with the full Cloud Core team.\nWe got some very important messages for our transformation journey that go far beyond this project that we need to focus on.\n\u00a0\nTo make it short, they have \"grilled\" me for 3 1/2 hours and it got very clear that our current way of operation does not work for customers like them. They want to move extremely fast and add another 100 mio subs with an iconic low cost, but high-end services phone.

Starting with the overall Nokia CES - the 12mmw CPV is 56.9% (as of Aug 13th) which compares to Huawei at 62.0% and Ericsson at 53.0%. There is no MN score available, but since MN accounts for most of the Nokia business, the Nokia score is highly aligned to the MN performance. Since high CPV scores are correlated with higher revenues and market share - it is in the best interests of each one of us to take action to improve the Nokia CPV score.\n\nLooking to the customer feedback specific to MN, the attribute with the largest number of comments is Design Quality at 1310 comments in the last 12 months, of which 60.6% are positive. We should be quite proud of this feedback. We must also recognize this performance is not good enough because we receive strong feedback from our leading customers that our current quality performance is insufficient. So let's celebrate the high positivity status and use this as motivation to build even higher quality hardware, software, documentation and solutions.\n\nThe second and third most commented attributes are Roadmap Execution (25.6% positive) and Feature Content (46.3% positive). You read that right - both attributes are well below 50% positivity. This feedback also appears as competitive pressures when our leaders talk with customers F2F. Internally, we see the result of these poor scores - manifested as pressure to inject additional features into programs after P2 and I6.\n\nHow can we improve our performance in these two attributes, and reduce the late injection of features into programs? Throughout MN, we each play a role in improving our performance. Improvement opportunities exists in feature candidate injection into the feature screening process, reduced prioritization of features never activated, faster and higher quality R&D and Test performance, as well as improved installability. Everyone can take a role in improving our performance.\n\nIn MN, we have a CPV champions network - colleagues representing each part of MN, who are leading the analysis and actioning of our current CPV gaps. This network of leaders is led by Delorenzo, Bob (Nokia - US/Irving) - please reach out to him to learn more, to find the colleague representing your unit, and to help improve our results.\n\ncc: Arora, Deepti (Nokia - US/Naperville), Mathew, Siby (Nokia - IN/Bangalore), Rouanne, Marc (Nokia - FR/Paris-Saclay)", "language": "en", "privacy": "public", "direct_message": false, "body": {"plain": "I'd like to share a summary of the Customer Engagement Survey (CES) feedback.
